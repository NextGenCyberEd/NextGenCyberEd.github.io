# Feedback Formulator

## Description

This prompt helps educators create constructive, balanced feedback on student work with specific improvement strategies. It's designed to provide feedback that is both encouraging and instructive, highlighting strengths while offering concrete suggestions for improvement.

## Prompt Template

```
Act as an expert educator and help me craft detailed, constructive feedback for a student's [ASSIGNMENT TYPE] on the topic of [TOPIC]. The student is in [GRADE LEVEL/AGE] and this assignment demonstrates [PROFICIENCY LEVEL] proficiency.

Here's a summary of the student's work:
[BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF STUDENT WORK]

The main strengths I've noticed are:
[LIST 1-3 STRENGTHS]

The main areas for improvement are:
[LIST 1-3 AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT]

Please create comprehensive feedback that includes:

1. OPENING ENCOURAGEMENT: A positive and personalized opening statement that acknowledges the student's effort and engagement.

2. SPECIFIC STRENGTHS: Detailed analysis of 3-5 specific strengths in the student's work, explaining why these aspects are effective and how they meet or exceed expectations. Use specific examples from their work.

3. GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES: Constructive feedback on 3-5 specific areas where the student could improve, framed as opportunities for growth rather than failures. For each area:
   * Clearly identify the issue
   * Explain why it matters
   * Provide a concrete, actionable suggestion for improvement
   * Include an example of what the improved work might look like

4. LEARNING RESOURCES: Suggest 2-3 specific resources (articles, videos, practice exercises) that would help the student address their growth areas.

5. NEXT STEPS: Give the student 2-3 clear, actionable steps they can take to apply this feedback to future work.

6. ENCOURAGING CLOSING: End with a motivating statement that expresses confidence in the student's ability to improve and reminds them of their strengths.

Format this feedback to be clear, specific, balanced, and actionable. Use a supportive, constructive tone throughout that motivates rather than discourages. The feedback should be detailed enough to be helpful but concise enough to be digestible.
