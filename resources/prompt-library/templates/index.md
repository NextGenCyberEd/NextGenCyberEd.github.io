# Prompt Templates

Our collection of general frameworks for prompt design. These templates provide versatile structures that can be adapted for a wide range of specific uses.

## Available Templates

### Step-by-Step Guides

Structured templates that break complex tasks into clear, sequential steps with explanations and examples at each stage.

### Persona-Based Templates

Frameworks that instruct the AI to adopt specific roles, expertise levels, or communication styles to better serve particular needs.

### Format-Specific Templates

Templates designed to generate content in specific formats, such as tables, outlines, comparisons, timelines, or flowcharts.

## How to Use

Each template is designed to be copied and pasted into your preferred LLM (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Bard) and then customized for your specific need. Unlike other prompts, these templates require more modification:

1. Select a template structure that matches your purpose
2. Replace the placeholder content with your specific subject matter
3. Adjust the instructions to focus on your particular goals
4. Add any domain-specific requirements or constraints
