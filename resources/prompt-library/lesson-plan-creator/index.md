## Description

This prompt generates complete lesson plans with differentiated activities and assessment strategies. It's designed for teachers who want to create engaging, well-structured lessons on cybersecurity or other topics, with options for different learning styles and abilities.

## Prompt Template

```
Act as an expert curriculum developer and create a detailed lesson plan for teaching [TOPIC] to [GRADE LEVEL/AGE] students. This lesson should be designed for a [LENGTH] class period.

Include the following components:

1. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: 3-5 specific, measurable learning objectives aligned with appropriate educational standards.

2. ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS: 2-3 open-ended questions that will guide student inquiry.

3. HOOK/INTRODUCTION: An engaging activity or question to capture student interest and activate prior knowledge (5-10 minutes).

4. DIRECT INSTRUCTION: Key content that needs to be explicitly taught, with clear explanations and examples (15-20 minutes).

5. GUIDED PRACTICE: A structured activity where students apply new knowledge with teacher support (15-20 minutes).

6. INDEPENDENT PRACTICE: Activities where students demonstrate understanding individually or in groups (15-20 minutes).

7. DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGIES:
   * For struggling learners
   * For advanced learners
   * For different learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)

8. ASSESSMENT STRATEGIES:
   * Formative assessment during the lesson
   * Summative assessment options
   * Success criteria for students

9. CLOSURE: A brief activity to summarize learning and check for understanding (5 minutes).

10. MATERIALS AND RESOURCES: List all required and optional materials, technology, handouts, etc.

11. HOMEWORK/EXTENSION: Meaningful follow-up work to reinforce learning (if appropriate).

12. TEACHER REFLECTION: Prompts for post-lesson evaluation and improvement.

Format this lesson plan with clear headings, bullet points where appropriate, and specific time allocations for each section. Make it practical and ready to implement in a real classroom setting.
```

## Usage Notes

1. Replace `[TOPIC]` with the specific cybersecurity concept you want to teach (e.g., "Password Security" or "Introduction to Cryptography")
2. Replace `[GRADE LEVEL/AGE]` with your target audience (e.g., "high school" or "9th grade" or "14-15 year old")
3. Replace `[LENGTH]` with the class duration (e.g., "45-minute" or "90-minute block")
4. For specialized content, you can add a line like: "The students have prior knowledge of [PREREQUISITE] but have not been introduced to [NEW CONCEPT] yet."
5. To align with specific standards, add: "This lesson should align with [SPECIFIC STANDARDS] standards for cybersecurity education."

## Example

### For a Password Security lesson:

```
Act as an expert curriculum developer and create a detailed lesson plan for teaching Password Security to middle school (grades 6-8) students. This lesson should be designed for a 50-minute class period.

Include the following components:

1. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: 3-5 specific, measurable learning objectives aligned with appropriate educational standards.

2. ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS: 2-3 open-ended questions that will guide student inquiry.

3. HOOK/INTRODUCTION: An engaging activity or question to capture student interest and activate prior knowledge (5-10 minutes).

4. DIRECT INSTRUCTION: Key content that needs to be explicitly taught, with clear explanations and examples (15-20 minutes).

5. GUIDED PRACTICE: A structured activity where students apply new knowledge with teacher support (15-20 minutes).

6. INDEPENDENT PRACTICE: Activities where students demonstrate understanding individually or in groups (15-20 minutes).

7. DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGIES:
   * For struggling learners
   * For advanced learners
   * For different learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)

8. ASSESSMENT STRATEGIES:
   * Formative assessment during the lesson
   * Summative assessment options
   * Success criteria for students

9. CLOSURE: A brief activity to summarize learning and check for understanding (5 minutes).

10. MATERIALS AND RESOURCES: List all required and optional materials, technology, handouts, etc.

11. HOMEWORK/EXTENSION: Meaningful follow-up work to reinforce learning (if appropriate).

12. TEACHER REFLECTION: Prompts for post-lesson evaluation and improvement.

Format this lesson plan with clear headings, bullet points where appropriate, and specific time allocations for each section. Make it practical and ready to implement in a real classroom setting. The students have basic computer skills but no prior cybersecurity knowledge.
