# Prompt Library

Welcome to the Next Gen Cyber Ed Prompt Library. This collection contains carefully crafted prompts for large language models (LLMs) that can be used for educational purposes in cybersecurity and beyond.

## What is a Prompt?

A prompt is a set of instructions given to an LLM (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Bard) that guides the AI in generating specific types of content. Well-crafted prompts can help you get more consistent, useful responses from these AI systems.
