## How to Use

Each prompt is designed to be copied and pasted into your preferred LLM (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Bard) with minimal modification. Simply replace the placeholder text [IN BRACKETS] with your specific information.

For code-related prompts, you'll typically need to:
1. Specify the programming language
2. Include the relevant code snippet
3. Provide context about what you're trying to accomplish
