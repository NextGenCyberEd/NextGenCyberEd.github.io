## Current Resources

### [Prompt Library](/resources/prompt-library/)

Our Prompt Library contains carefully crafted prompts for large language models (LLMs) that can be used for educational purposes. These prompts are designed to help:

- **Students** learn about cybersecurity concepts, study more effectively, and explore technical topics
- **Educators** create lesson plans, provide better feedback, and develop engaging learning materials
- **Anyone** interested in using AI tools to enhance their cybersecurity learning experience

## Coming Soon

We're continuously working on developing and curating new resources. Here's what we have planned:

- **Curriculum Guides**: Framework-aligned cybersecurity curriculum resources for K-12 educators
- **Learning Pathways**: Structured guides to help students progress from beginner to advanced levels
- **Tools Database**: Curated collection of free cybersecurity tools suitable for educational use
- **Webinar Library**: Recorded sessions with industry experts on various cybersecurity topics
