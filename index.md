# Welcome to Next Gen Cyber Ed

At Next Gen Cyber Ed, we bridge the gap between K-12 cybersecurity education and industry resources, creating pathways for students to explore and succeed in cybersecurity careers.

## Our Mission

We strengthen cybersecurity education by connecting educators and students with trusted resources, hands-on experiences, and industry partnerships. Our role as a facilitator ensures that both teachers and students have access to the best available tools and opportunities in the cybersecurity field.

## Resources

We provide free resources for students and educators, including:

- [Prompt Library](/resources/prompt-library/) - A collection of educational and technical prompts for large language models
- More resources coming soon!
